# ADR-001: Framework Choice — Next.js 15 App Router

**Date:** June 2026  
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

We need a full-stack TypeScript framework that can serve both the dashboard UI and the REST API from a single repository. Options considered: Next.js 15, Remix 2, plain Express + React SPA.

## Decision

Use **Next.js 15 App Router** with TypeScript strict mode.

## Reasoning

Next.js provides co-located API routes (Route Handlers) and server components in the same project. The App Router's server components reduce client-side JavaScript for the list view, helping hit the < 1.5s render target.

## Rejected Alternatives

**Remix 2:**  
Remix has excellent data loading patterns but the team has no existing Remix projects. Switching would require a new deployment profile and more onboarding time.

**Express + React SPA:**  
Separating the API server and the frontend into two packages increases CI complexity and deployment surface without adding value at this scale.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Single `pnpm dev` starts everything; Claude Code can scaffold routes and pages in one pass.
- **Negative:** App Router has a learning curve for junior developers unfamiliar with RSC. Mitigated by keeping data fetching in server components only.
